Milestone 3:
Add Features.
Status: In progress.  

I have run into many more converting issues than expected. I've spent many more hours converting than originally anticipated, and that's been the main bottle neck. I'm chipping away at it, but by the end, eChits will be ready to hand off to any developer familiar with the framework. 

Some of the main things I accomplished this milestone were forcing the authentication and profile registration, which required putting extra code in the navbar. 

/tools/demo.php works. I did the revealable and hide-able 100% solution as well. 

I will be able to get everything done, it's just taking longer than expected.

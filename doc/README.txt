Milestone 1:
Conversion to Framework
Status: Good progress has been made. 

Two of my simpler pages have been converted over, and I redid the whole database and lib_db to work with the framework. Although 50% of the pages are not converted, I think about 50% of the work is done as I slowly figure out how I'm going to convert everything and get all the moving pieces talking again. 

query.php works as expected. 

On track.

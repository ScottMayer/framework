Milestone 2:
Complete Conversion to Framework
Status: Almost complete. 

I am almost completely done converting. I've run into many more issues than expected, including adapting my rudimentary user access controls to the framework, database access levels, breaking apart pages into multiple pages, issues with large database calls, and using ajax to do posts to the database. All in all, I only have a few more pages to convert, and then I need to fix how the divs render with the different font used by the framework. 

upload.php works as expected. I did the progress bar as well for the challenge problem. 

On track.

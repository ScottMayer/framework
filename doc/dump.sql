Having a refrigerator will assist me in adhering to a healthy diet and allow me to safely and properly manage my weight throughout the year, a standard required of me being a member of the Varsity Lightweight Crew Team. Maintaining weight standards can be difficult without proper and regular nutrition available. At this point in time King Hall no longer maintains hours conducive with my practice schedule. For example, morning practice during the week regularly runs to 0730 and on Saturdays as late as 1000. Afternoon practices routinely end at 1900, leaving very few nutritional options in King Hall.  Additionally I have had instances of getting to King Hall minutes before the closing time and being asked to leave by the staff. Our company\\\'s wardroom fridge is a convenient resource; however, whenever I have tried to store food there in the past, I ran the risk of it being taken or there not being adequate room. It would also be unfair to ask for a significant amount of space dedicated to a single person. If I am allowed to maintain a refrigerator, I will ensure it complies with room-inspection standards.  Additionally, I have attached a letter from my Primary Care Physician, Dr. Jonathon Mumma, M.D. indicating the merits of having my personal nutrition resources.
